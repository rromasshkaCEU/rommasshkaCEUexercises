Exercises #2: Recursive Algorithms

1. The sum 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + n.
2. Factorial of a given number
3. The n-th power of a natural number.
4. The sum of the elements in a list of numbers.
5. The arithmetic mean of a list of numbers.
6. The standard deviation of a list of numbers.
7. The sum of the first even numbers up to n , assuming n ≥ 2.
For example, sumEven(9) = 8 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 20
8. The sum of the even elements in a list of integers
For example. SumEven([1, 2, 3, 4]) = 4
9. Given a list of natural numbers greater than or equal to 2, obtain another list with
the even numbers from the initial list, in the same order and preserving duplicates.
For example, getEvenList([1, 2, 6, 11]) = [2, 6]
10. The list of the first even numbers up to n, assuming n ≥ 2
For example, evenList(9) = [2, 4, 6, 8]
11. The scalar product (or dot product) of two non-empty lists of numbers with the
same size.
For example,
computeDotProduct([1,2,3], [2, 4, 6]) = 1 × 2 + 2 × 4 + 3 × 6 = 2 + 8 + 18 = 28.

Exercise 5.
Create a recursive function that receives a String and returns the sum of all its characters.
The header of the function is the following:
public static int sumCodes(String str)
Exercise 6.
Create a recursive function that receives a String and converts it according to Caesar
cipher. The header of the function is the following:
public static String cesarCipher(String str, int shift)
